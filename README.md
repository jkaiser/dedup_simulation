# dedup_simulation
This deduplication simulator was used for two research papers [1,2]. It uses deduplication traces as generated by Meister's fs-c tool (https://github.com/dmeister/fs-c) as input.

- **container caching** The basic deduplication approach introduced by Zhu et. al [3]
- **Sparse Indexing** The basic deduplication approach introduced by Lillibridge et. al [3]
