# dedup_simulation
This deduplication simulator was used for two research papers [1,2]. It uses deduplication traces as generated by Meister's fs-c tool (https://github.com/dmeister/fs-c) as input.

The implemented deduplication approaches are:
- **container caching** The basic deduplication approach introduced by Zhu et. al [3]
- **Sparse Indexing** The basic deduplication approach introduced by Lillibridge et. al [4]
- **Block Locality Caching** The basic deduplication approach introduced by Meister et. al [5]

As discussed in [1], each approach also is possible in a version performing _exact_ deduplication as well as a version performing _approximate_ deduplication. Both versions are included. The approximate versions of container caching and Block Locality Caching are called *sampling*<name>.
